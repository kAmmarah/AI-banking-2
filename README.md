# AI Banking – Real-Time Transaction Monitoring

**Created by: Amara Dawood**

## Overview

AI Banking is an AI-powered web application prototype built for the **JS Bank PROCOM ’26 Hackathon – AI in Banking**. The project focuses on **real-time monitoring of banking transactions** to detect suspicious and potentially fraudulent activities using artificial intelligence.

The solution demonstrates how AI can assist banks in proactively identifying fraud, reducing financial losses, and improving customer trust—using only **synthetic data** and a **working end-to-end flow**.

---

## Problem Statement

Banks process thousands of transactions every minute. Traditional rule-based systems:

* Miss new or evolving fraud patterns
* Generate high false positives
* React too late to suspicious activity

There is a need for a **real-time, AI-driven monitoring system** that can intelligently analyze transactions as they occur and flag high-risk behavior instantly.

---

## Solution

AI Banking provides:

* Real-time transaction monitoring
* AI-based fraud risk scoring
* Clear alerts for suspicious activity
* A simple dashboard for analysis and decision-making

The system simulates how modern banks can use AI to **detect fraud early**, **support internal risk teams**, and **protect customers**.

---

## Key Features

* 🔍 **Real-Time Transaction Analysis**
* 🚨 **AI-Based Fraud Detection (Risk Flagging)**
* 👤 **Customer Risk Profiling**
* 📊 **Transaction & Fraud Dashboard**
* 🧠 **Explainable AI Logic (Demo-Level)**

---

## AI Usage

The application uses AI in a **meaningful and focused way**:

* Machine Learning–based fraud classification
* Pattern detection on transaction amount, frequency, and type
* Risk scoring instead of hard rule-based decisions

AI improves:

* Speed of detection
* Accuracy over static rules
* Adaptability to new fraud patterns

---

## Data

* 100% **synthetic data** (hackathon compliant)
* No real customer or bank data used

### Included Datasets:

* `customers.csv` – Customer profiles and risk levels
* `transactions_sales.csv` – Transaction & sales data
* `fraud_cases.csv` – Flagged fraudulent transactions

---

## Tech Stack (Prototype Level)

* **Frontend:** Web-based UI (Dashboard)
* **Backend:** Python-based logic
* **AI/ML:** Fraud classification & risk scoring
* **Data:** CSV-based synthetic datasets

(Designed at **Option B – Sophisticated Prototype** level)

---

## Demo

A **2–3 minute demo video** showcases:

1. The banking fraud problem
2. Live transaction monitoring
3. AI-based fraud alerts
4. How banks can act on AI insights

---

## Responsible AI Considerations

* No personal identifiable information (PII)
* Transparent AI behavior (risk flags, not black-box decisions)
* AI assists humans, does not replace final decisions
* Clear limitations documented

---

## Limitations

* Prototype-level AI model
* Synthetic data only
* No real-time bank system integration

---

## Future Enhancements

* Adaptive learning from new fraud patterns
* Integration with bank core systems
* Multi-factor risk signals (location, device, behavior)
* Role-based dashboards for bank teams

---

## Conclusion

AI Banking demonstrates how **real-time AI monitoring** can meaningfully improve fraud detection in banking. The project is realistic, scalable, and aligned with modern banking needs while remaining safe, ethical, and hackathon-compliant.
